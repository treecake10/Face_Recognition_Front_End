## Step 1

Signin/Register through a PostgreSQL database.

## Step 2

Find any image of a human face on the web, copy & paste the image url link into the box and hit submit. 

## Step 3 

Using the Clarifai API's face detection model, Machine learning is applied to trace a bounding box around the face of a human in the image.

## Finally

This application keeps track of the number of image entries submitted by the user, which can be stored and retrieved.
